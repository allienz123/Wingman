This application uses facial recognition provided by face.com , to allow you to take a picture of a face, which the application will then use to try and identify the person in the picture. Please refer to their privacy policy at http://developers.face.com/docs/terms/privacy/   

In order for it to be able to identify a person it relies entirely on users submitting identification data, such as the name of a person in a picture.
